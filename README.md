NoteTaker C# webapi


Welcome to Note Taker, a simple web-application where you can track Tasks written in C#.NET core and Javascript.

##  Setup  
This application uses sqlite3 for its database, so remember to add sqlite3 to your path.

##  Technologies  

This application uses C#.net dore webapi for its backend and normal html with javascript for its client, no FE frameworks.  
Javascript uses normal Fetch for accessing the API.  
(Had issues with both CORS and is therefore not utilized.)  
The backend utilizes Swagger ui for its Api dev environment.  
To access the client, find the index.html file in noteTaker/wwwroot/index.html.  

##  Usage  
In index.html you can enter, edit, view and delete notes.   
localhost:7013/index.html  
You can use Swagger ui to check the endpoints.
