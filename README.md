NoteTaker C# webapi


Welcome to Note Taker, a simple web-application where you can track Tasks written in C#.NET core and Javascript.

## Issues
This was made very quickly as a test and is going to be completely remade in the future. Bad promises, no unit testing, aswell as a whole myriad of other issues. Prettier frontend is in the works (betterIndex.html and betterIndexStyling.css). It however is fully functional! 

##  Setup  
This application uses sqlite3 for its database, so remember to add sqlite3 to your path.

##  Technologies  

This application uses C#.net dore webapi for its backend and normal html with javascript for its client, no FE frameworks.  
Javascript uses normal Fetch for accessing the API.  
(Had issues with both CORS and is therefore not utilized.)  
The backend utilizes Swagger ui for its Api dev environment.  
To access the client, find the index.html file in noteTaker/wwwroot/index.html.  

##  Usage  
In index.html you can enter, edit, view and delete notes.   
localhost:7013/index.html  
You can use Swagger ui to check the endpoints.
